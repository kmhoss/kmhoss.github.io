title: About Me
---

I'm currently working as a Machine Learning Research Scientist at GE Aerospace Research, where I focus on building large language models (LLMs), time-series foundation models, and developing robust ML systems.

Previously, I was a Graduate Research Assistant at UMBC for 5 years, working on backdoor detection in neural networks, EEG and fMRI signal analysis, and deep learning in neuroimaging.

My goal is to combine rigorous ML research with impactful real-world applications.
