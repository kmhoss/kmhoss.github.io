### ðŸ§  Foundation Model for GE Aerospace
- Built the first time-series foundation model using VAE, Transformers, and 1D CNNs.
- Used for anomaly detection, missing data imputation, and forecasting.

### ðŸ§ª Trojan Attack Detection in DNNs (IARPA-funded)
- Built pipelines to detect backdoors in CV/NLP/GNN models.
- Used distillation, matrix/tensor factorization, and GCNs.
- Targeted models: ResNet, BERT, GPT-2, Inception, LSTM.

### ðŸ§¬ Dynamic Brain Connectivity with Tensor Decomposition
- NSF and NIH-funded project analyzing fMRI brain activity.
- Applied ICA and IVA to model spatio-temporal changes in functional networks.

### ðŸ§  EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces
- Evaluated deep learning models for BCI and Parkinsonâ€™s detection.
- Contributed to neurorehabilitation advancements.
